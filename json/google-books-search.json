        "description": "Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape. In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world’s top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they’re fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You’ll learn how to: –Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization –Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing –Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs –Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy –Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, \"Security Engineering Cheat Sheets\" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you’re most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.",

About This Book This book covers the latest technologies such as Advance XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection, Web API testing, XML attack vectors, OAuth 2.0 Security, and more involved in today's web applications Penetrate and secure your web application using various techniques Get this comprehensive reference guide that provides advanced tricks and tools of the trade for seasoned penetration testers Who This Book Is For This book is for security professionals and penetration testers who want to speed up their modern web application penetrating testing. It will also benefit those at an intermediate level and web developers who need to be aware of the latest application hacking techniques. What You Will Learn Get to know the new and less-publicized techniques such PHP Object Injection and XML-based vectors Work with different security tools to automate most of the redundant tasks See different kinds of newly-designed security headers and how they help to provide security Exploit and detect different kinds of XSS vulnerabilities Protect your web application using filtering mechanisms Understand old school and classic web hacking in depth using SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF Grasp XML-related vulnerabilities and attack vectors such as XXE and DoS techniques Get to know how to test REST APIs to discover security issues in them In Detail Web penetration testing is a growing, fast-moving, and absolutely critical field in information security. This book executes modern web application attacks and utilises cutting-edge hacking techniques with an enhanced knowledge of web application security. We will cover web hacking techniques so you can explore the attack vectors during penetration tests. The book encompasses the latest technologies such as OAuth 2.0, Web API testing methodologies and XML vectors used by hackers. Some lesser discussed attack vectors such as RPO (relative path overwrite), DOM clobbering, PHP Object Injection and etc. has been covered in this book. We'll explain various old school techniques in depth such as XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection through the ever-dependable SQLMap and reconnaissance. Websites nowadays provide APIs to allow integration with third party applications, thereby exposing a lot of attack surface, we cover testing of these APIs using real-life examples. This pragmatic guide will be a great benefit and will help you prepare fully secure applications. Style and approach This master-level guide covers various techniques serially. It is power-packed with real-world examples that focus more on the practical aspects of implementing the techniques rather going into detailed theory.",

        "description": "JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev is your guide to the wild, vast, and untamed frontier that is JavaScript development. The JavaScript tooling landscape has grown and matured drastically in the past several years. This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries, frameworks, and utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers. It covers tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side. While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev focuses on incredibly useful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores. The libraries and frameworks covered include Bower, Grunt, Yeoman, PM2, RequireJS, Browserify, Knockout, AngularJS, Kraken, Mach, Mongoose, Knex, Bookshelf, Faye, Q, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash. Written from first-hand experience, you will benefit from the glorious victories and innumerable failures of two experienced professionals, gain quick insight into hurdles that aren't always explicitly mentioned in API documentation or Readmes, and quickly learn how to use JavaScript frameworks and libraries like a Pro. Enrich your development skills with JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev today.",
